An adaptive and powerful points management system for WordPress powered websites.

== Description ==

myCRED is an adaptive points management system that lets you build a broad range of point related applications for your WordPress powered website.
Store reward systems, community leaderboards, online banking or monetizing your websites content, are a few examples of the ways myCRED is used.

= Points =

Each user on your WordPress websites gets their own point balance which you can manually [adjust](https://mycred.me/about/features/#points-management) at any time. You can use just one point balance or setup multiple types of balances. How these balances are accessed, used or shows is entirely up to you.


= Log =

Each time myCRED adds or deducts points from a user, the adjustment is [logged](https://mycred.me/about/features/#account-history) in a dedicated log, allowing your users to browse their history. The log is also used to provide you with statistics, accountability, badges, ranks and to enforce limits you might set.


= Awarding or Deducting Points Automatically =

myCRED supports a vast set of ways you can automatically give / take points from a user. Everything from new comments to store purchases. These automatic adjustments are managed by so called [Hooks](https://mycred.me/about/features/#automatic-points) which you can setup in your admin area.


= Third-party plugin Support =

myCRED supports some of the most [popular plugins](https://mycred.me/about/supported-plugins/) for WordPress like BuddyPress, WooCommerce, Jetpack, Contact Form 7 etc. To prevent to much cluttering in the admin area with settings, myCRED will only show features/settings for third-party plugins that are installed and enabled.


= Add-ons =

There is so much more to myCRED then just adjusting balances. The plugin comes with several [built-in add-ons](https://mycred.me/add-ons/) which enabled more complex features such as allowing point transfers, buying points for real money, allow payments in stores etc.


= Documentation =

You can find extensive [documentation](http://codex.mycred.me/) on everything myCRED related in the myCRED Codex. You can also find a list of [frequently asked](https://mycred.me/about/faq/) questions on the myCRED website.


= Customizations =

myCRED was not built to "do-it-all". Instead a lot of effort has been made to make the plugin as developer friendly as possible. If you need a custom feature built, you can submit a [request for a quote](https://mycred.me/customize/request-quote/) via the myCRED website.


= Code Snippets =

The most commonly asked customizations for myCRED are available as code snippets on the [myCRED website](https://mycred.me/code-snippets/), free to use by anyone.


= Support =

Support is offered on our [myCRED website](https://mycred.me/support/)  from Monday to Friday 9AM - 5PM (GMT+5). Submit [customization request](https://mycred.me/customize/request-quote/) or open a [support ticket](https://mycred.me/support/) If you have trouble with myCRED which is not described in documentation also you can consult the [online community](https://mycred.me/support/forums/) for your question. We pay myCRED Store Tokens as a reward on reporting bugs and their fixes as well. Support is not entertained here on the wordpress.org support forum or on any social media account.
